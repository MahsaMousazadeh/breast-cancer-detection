# Breast Cancer Detection
Implementing Machine Learning Classification Algorithms for predicting Breast Cancer:
1) Logistic Regression = 89%
2) Random Forest Classifier = 90%
3) Histogram-based Gradient = 87%
4) Gaussian Naive Bayes = 87%

## About Dataset
You can download the dataset from here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer" target="_blank">Dataset</a>
This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from the 2017 November update of the SEER Program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer (SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3) diagnosed in 2006-2010. Patients with unknown tumour size, examined regional LNs, positive regional LNs, and patients whose survival months were less than 1 month were excluded; thus, 4024 patients were ultimately included.
